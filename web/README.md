# The Daily Bark Web

The endpoint is build using [Golang's](https://golang.org/) [Gin Gonic](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/) framework. It obtains data scraped stories from redis and randomly substitutes names, adjectives, and nouns.  It will also send a url down of an image that might relate to some of the story.

The front-end is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and (in typical Node fashion) dwarfs the rest of the codebase. The whole Node build set up was generating using the Vue cli tools.
